CodeBook.md:  describes the treatment process of variables, data transformations and work performed to clean up the data and reach the requirements of the assignment.

run_analysis.R:  performs the data preparation and the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition:
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
